Second Milestone Project- Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute

Welcome to my project, the Quizijuana app.

Quizijuana is my second assignment for the Full Stack Development course at Code Institute. The requirements for this project were to develop a front-end web application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In addition, the implementation of front-end interactivity, using core JavaScript, JavaScript libraries and/or APIs were also necessary. Testing is crucial through development, implementation and deployment stages for the app.

I aim to build a fun and interactive quiz app related to Marijuana to allow users to learn and test their knowledge on this magical hemp plant. My inspiration for this project comes from the many controversial news surrounding marijuana, and its huge increase in legalisation and its use for medical and recreational purposes globally. The questions in this quiz will cover a wide range of topics related to Marijuana, including questions about history, potency, political status and more. This quiz can not only be used for entertaining purposes, but also for educational and activist purposes.

## **User Experience**
---

In this section, I am going to provide insights into my UX process, mainly focusing on who this web application is built for, what they intent to achieve and how they can best utilise this web application to fulfil their needs.

According to Caglar Araz from UX Collective, User Experience (UX) is "User experience refers to the singular and accumulated experiences that occur for users as a consequence of them interacting with an object in a given context."

The planning and development of this project is divided into 5 planes:

1. The Strategy Plane
2. The Scope Plane
3. The Structure Plane
4. The Skeleton Plane
5. The Surface Plane
