Second Milestone Project- Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute

Welcome to my project, the Quizijuana app.

Quizijuana is my second assignment for the Full Stack Development course at Code Institute. The requirements for this project were to develop a front-end web application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In addition, the implementation of front-end interactivity, using core JavaScript, JavaScript libraries and/or APIs were also necessary. Testing is crucial through development, implementation and deployment stages for the app.

I aim to build a fun and interactive quiz app related to Marijuana to allow users to learn and test their knowledge on this magical hemp plant. My inspiration for this project comes from the many controversial news surrounding marijuana, and its huge increase in legalisation and its use for medical and recreational purposes globally. The questions in this quiz will cover a wide range of topics related to Marijuana, including questions about history, potency, political status and more. This quiz can not only be used for entertaining purposes, but also for educational and activist purposes.
